# Journal App Frontend (AI-Assisted)

This is the **frontend** for the [Journal App Backend](https://github.com/pritam-purkait/journal-app-backend-springboot.git), a personal journaling platform built using **Spring Boot** for the backend. This frontend was initially generated using **AI assistance** to rapidly prototype the user interface and connect it with the backend API. It has since been **modified and extended** with custom features and logic by me.
